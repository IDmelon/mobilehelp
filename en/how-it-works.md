## How it works?

To start using your smartphone as a security key on a computer, first you need to either pair your smartphone with that computer or have an IDmelon Reader.

Choose your status:

[I already paired with my PC.](/services.html){: .btn .mr-4 }

[I want to pair with my PC.](/mobilehelp/en/pairing/step1.html){: .btn .mr-4 }

[I have an IDmelon Reader.](/mobilehelp/en/pairing/reader.html){: .btn .mr-4 }

[What is the IDmelon Reader?](/mobilehelp/en/pairing/reader.html){: .btn .mr-4 }
